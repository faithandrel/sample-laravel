This repository contains code samples to a working project.
It is a Laravel app which serves as an API backend to a mobile app.

In order to showcase my knowledge on advanced code for Laravel, I included the notifications feature of the project.
I added explanation for the codes at the end of the files. 
Please start at AccessController (app/Http/Controllers/AccessController.php)

I added a migration and also javascript/typescript code from the mobile client.
You may also notice that there is no view files since the server returns only JSON for the mobile.
